      <h2>Captain America</h2>
      <p>
        Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published 
        by Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character 
        first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover dated March 1941) from 
        Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed 
        as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II 
        and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. 
        The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America 
        comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since 
        Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in 
        publication.
